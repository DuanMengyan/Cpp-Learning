Faith is indispensable in one's life. 
It just like the light in the dark, which leads people to get out of trouble time.
Many successful people have shared the secret of making great achievement. 
They owed the success to the faith of never give up. 
Everybody wants to be different, but only few of them can make it. What makes them different? 
It is to hold the strong faith. 
For me, when I felt disappointed about my study and had no idea what to do, my parents and friends encouraged me to move on, then the difficult time would pass finally. 
So I told myself no matter what happened, never to stop making progress. 
The strong faith helped me go through many difficulties and makes me who I am today. 
Keeping your strong faith and have the positive attitude to life, then you will see the victory.
